<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GPS Attenna Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active GPS Attenna Module</li><li>Passive GPS Attenna Module</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active GPS antenna modules contain a Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) which amplifies the GPS signal before sending it to the GPS receiver, thus enhancing the signal strength and improving accuracy. Passive GPS antenna modules, on the other hand, do not contain an amplifier and rely solely on the GPS receiver to process the signal. Active modules are typically more expensive but offer better performance in challenging environments, while passive modules are simpler and cheaper but may have weaker signal strength in certain conditions.</p></p>
