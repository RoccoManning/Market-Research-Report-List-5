<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electron Beam Welding Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Welding Torch</li><li>Mobile Welding Torch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stationary welding torch systems are fixed in one position and are suitable for welding workpieces that can be easily manipulated into position. These systems are commonly used for welding large or heavy parts that are difficult to move during the welding process. On the other hand, mobile welding torch systems are designed to be moved around the workpiece, making them ideal for welding applications where it is not feasible to bring the workpiece to the welding torch. Both types of systems offer unique advantages depending on the specific welding requirements.</p></p>
