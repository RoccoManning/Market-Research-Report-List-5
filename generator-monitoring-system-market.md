<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Generator Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Web-based</li><li>On-Premises</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Generator monitoring systems can be classified into two main types: Web-based and On-Premises. Web-based systems rely on cloud technology to collect data from generators and provide real-time monitoring and analysis through a web interface. This offers flexibility and accessibility for users to access the system from any location. On the other hand, On-Premises systems store and process data locally, allowing for greater control and security but may require more maintenance and resources to operate effectively. Both types have their own advantages and cater to different preferences and needs of users.</p></p>
