<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Wrap Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Film</li><li>Calendered Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive wrap film is divided into two main types: cast film and calendered film. Cast film is manufactured using a casting process where the liquid resin is spread onto a release paper and then cured to form a thin, durable film. This type of film is known for its high quality finish and conformability to complex shapes. Calendered film, on the other hand, is produced using a calendaring process which involves passing the heated resin through a series of rollers to create a uniform thickness. Calendered film is more cost-effective but may not offer the same level of durability and finish as cast film.</p></p>
