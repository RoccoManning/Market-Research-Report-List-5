<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SWIR InGaAs Line Scan Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-cooled</li><li>Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SWIR InGaAs line scan cameras can be categorized into two types based on their cooling mechanism: non-cooled and cooled cameras. Non-cooled cameras do not require any additional cooling system, resulting in a simpler and more cost-effective solution. On the other hand, cooled cameras utilize a cooling system to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce dark current, making them ideal for high-sensitivity applications. Both types of cameras offer unique benefits and are suitable for different imaging requirements in industrial, scientific, and defense applications.</p></p>
