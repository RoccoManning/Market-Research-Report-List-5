<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vertical Cryogenic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Non-Submersible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vertical cryogenic pumps are divided into two main types: submersible and non-submersible. Submersible pumps are designed to be completely submerged in the cryogenic liquid, providing efficient and reliable operation by minimizing heat ingress from the environment. On the other hand, non-submersible pumps are installed outside of the cryogenic tank or container and use a shaft to transfer the cryogenic liquid, making them suitable for applications where submersion is not possible or preferred. Both types offer unique advantages based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
