<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIG Guns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TIG guns can be categorized into two main types: water cooled and air cooled. Water cooled TIG guns are equipped with a water circulation system that helps to dissipate heat more effectively, making them suitable for long welding sessions and high amperage applications. On the other hand, air cooled TIG guns rely on air flow to cool down the gun during welding, making them more portable and easier to handle for lighter applications. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the welding job.</p></p>
