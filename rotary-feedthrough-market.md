<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Feedthrough Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Shaft</li><li>Hollow Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary feedthroughs are used to transfer rotational motion and power through a vacuum or pressure barrier. There are two main types of rotary feedthrough markets: solid shaft and hollow shaft. Solid shaft rotary feedthroughs have a continuous solid rod passing through the barrier, providing stability and strength. On the other hand, hollow shaft rotary feedthroughs have an empty core, allowing for the passage of fluids or wires. Both types are used in various industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, aerospace, and research laboratories.</p></p>
