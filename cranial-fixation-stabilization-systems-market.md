<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Fixation & Stabilization Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resorbable Fixation Systems</li><li>Nonresorbable Fixation Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cranial fixation and stabilization systems are medical devices used to secure bone flaps during cranial surgeries. Resorbable fixation systems are made of materials that dissolve over time, reducing the need for removal surgery. Nonresorbable fixation systems, on the other hand, are made of materials like titanium or stainless steel that remain in the body permanently. Both types of systems play a crucial role in ensuring the stability and healing of cranial fractures or defects.</p></p>
