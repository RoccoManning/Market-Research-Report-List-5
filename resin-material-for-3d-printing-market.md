<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resin Material for 3D Printing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Luquid Resin</li><li>Solid Resin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Resin materials for 3D printing come in two main types: liquid resin and solid resin. Liquid resin is commonly used in stereolithography (SLA) printing and is poured into a vat where a laser cures it layer by layer. Solid resin, on the other hand, is typically used in digital light processing (DLP) printing and is a solid material that is cured by a UV light source. Both types of resin materials offer unique advantages and applications in the 3D printing market.</p></p>
