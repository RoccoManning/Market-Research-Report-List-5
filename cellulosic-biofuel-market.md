<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulosic Biofuel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Food Crops Fuel</li><li>Non-Food Crops Fuel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cellulosic biofuels derived from food crops, such as corn and sugarcane, are known as food crops fuel. These biofuels are produced from the edible parts of the plant, leading to concerns about competition with food production. On the other hand, non-food crops fuel is produced from sources like switchgrass and wood chips, eliminating this competition. Non-food crops fuel offers a more sustainable alternative to food crops fuel, as it utilizes plant materials that are not intended for human consumption.</p></p>
