<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Surfacing Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Processing</li><li>Out-Of-Autoclave Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite surfacing films are used in the aerospace industry for smooth finishing of composite materials. Autoclave processing involves placing the composite material and surfacing film in an autoclave for curing under heat and pressure. Out-of-autoclave processing, on the other hand, refers to curing the composite material and surfacing film using alternative methods such as vacuum bagging or oven curing, without the need for an autoclave. Both methods have their own advantages and are used based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
